# StudentManagement-JavaSpringBoot
CRUD students with UI to interact
I used mvc model but I used a same model like Nestjs before, I really want update more useful thing like DTO, update validate data when you entered the wrong datatype, especially I really want to use bcrypt as before, Ahhh Damnn it
btw Hope u enjoy it, I made 2 classes of service, 1 guy is interface and I want the real one implement it so it can be easy to maintaince and replace <3
